<!-- Cogs are encapsulated component definitions composed of 3 root tags.
    blueprint - contians conginition framework specific html style tags.
                These tags provide declarative funcitonality and allow communitcation with
                and instantiation of other cogs.
    display   - is the html template for the cog in regulate HTML.
                THe HTML will be created as written in the cog's continer except for "id"
                attrubutes which will be changed to unique values for the application.
                Selctors for each id object will be loaded into the cog's "this" scope
                and accessible in the script tag.
    script    - defines the cog's local methods. By default the "init" and "destroy"
                methods are called on cog creation and destruction. Other methods are called
                via the tags in the blueprint scetion or from other methods.
